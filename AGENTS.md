# Safety Rules

## Data Protection (Highest Priority)

- Never execute any destructive data operation without a verified backup first.
- Destructive operations include (but are not limited to): deleting database files, `prisma migrate reset`, `db reset`, truncation, dropping tables, or any command that can remove existing data.
- Before any such operation, require:
  - explicit user approval for the destructive step;
  - a completed backup with a concrete backup path;
  - a quick restore validation (or at minimum a backup file existence/size check).
- If backup is missing or unverified, stop and do not proceed.

## Architecture Rules

- If a single source file becomes too long, it must be split into functional modules.
- Hard threshold: when a source file exceeds 500 lines, refactoring and modularization are mandatory before continuing feature expansion.
